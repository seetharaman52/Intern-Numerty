Array List:

Dynamic, Faster Iterations and Random Access
Not synchronized by default (not thread - safe)
More memory efficient to vector

Vector:
Synchronized by default (thread - safe)
Slightly slower than Array List
Faster Iterations and Random Access

Linked List:
Faster insertion and deletion at any position
Slower random Access than Array List and vector
Not Synchronized by default, Uses more memory (due to more pointers)
